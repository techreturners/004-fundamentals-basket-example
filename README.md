# Week 1 - Programming Fundamentals 

# Basket example

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for the basket example we have been covering this week.

## Getting the code

You can 'fork' this repository by clicking the **Fork** button shown towards the top right of this screen.

When you **fork** a repository, it takes a copy of ALL the code and files and puts it in to your own GitHub account.

Once you have forked your repository you should be able to clone it from your own account by replacing the **YOURUSERNAME** part with your actual GitHub username.

```
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/004-fundamentals-basket-example.git
```

## Running the code

Once you have 'cloned' the code you can run the tests.

In order to run the tests you do:

```
npm install
```

NOTE: You only need to run `npm install` once, after first cloning.

and then do 

```
npm test
```

## A failing test

When running the tests you'll notice that one of the tests is currently failing. The test is a valid test so that must mean that the basket is performing incorrectly.

Take a good at fixing the basket so that the test passes.

Once you've fixed that test, go ahead and **commit** your code and **push** the changes up to GitHub.
